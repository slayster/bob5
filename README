Summary
-------

I've spent ten years writing and re-writing various custom content management
systems. Now it is time to bring all that experience together in to a single
project. There has of course been re-use over the years but there is room for
more. There have been versions of GCMS before, this will technically be the
third major version. However the older versions were not publically released 
and this version is to be a complete rewrite, so I have reset any version
numbers. I have always avoided other frameworks in the past as I like to keep
the whole codebase in my head so I always know exactly what it going on. So 
this may not be much use to anyone but me, but the option is there.
